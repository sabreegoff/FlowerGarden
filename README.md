# FlowerGarden

![FlowerGarden screen shot](/Screenshot.png?raw=true)

My game is called flower garden and the main idea is to be able to plant flowers,
water them, and watch them grow. I imported standard unity assets, got some
from the asset store and made a couple of things in blender. Hopefully it is
semi intuitive but if not, move the player with the WASD keys and rotate player
with the mouse. The player was imported as a first person shooter which you may
notice. The player equips tools and is able to perform actions based on whatever
tool is equipped. To equip the shovel press "1" and the player will have access
to plant seeds. To plant press the "q" key. To equip the watering can, press
the "2" key and the player will have access to water the plants by pressing the
the "q" key (I havenâ€™t animated/implemented water yet because I'm learning its
a little more complex than I planned for it to be I have a particle affect
commented out in the script but still messing with it). To equip the hoe
press the "3" key and the player will have access to clip the plants (may change
the hoe to a knife or scissors), the player will do this by pressing "q" which
isn't available yet. I have a couple of pickups I left in the scene for visual
purposes (seeds and water). I haven't written a script to randomly spawn them yet.
I also put an animated flower in the scene for visual purposes which I haven't
implemented with planting yet because there are a lot of flowers and I am
planning on randomizing them. After clipping the flowers I want the player
to be able to make flower arrangements or bouquets. Hopefully you enjoy what I
have so far! :)

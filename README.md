# FlowerGarden

![FlowerGarden screen shot](/Screenshot.png?raw=true)

Starting the game youll start with 0 water, 0 seeds, and 0 flowers. To get seeds
and water you will walk around the scene and collect pickups. The goal is to create
a bouquet of 12 flowers. In order to obtain flowers, youll need to plant the seeds
(using the 1 key which gives you a shovel, and the q key which plants the seeds)
the flower will immediatly start to grow but it will be sad and very slow. To
speed up the process so your not waiting all day press the 2 key for the watering pale
and press q to water. you will see the flower go from sad to content to happy then
to sad again if over watered. Be careful not to overwater because the plant takes
FOREVER to grow when it is sad (it grows the fastest at the happy state). Once the
plant is fully grown you will need to cut it to add to your bouquet. To do so
press 3 and get within range of the plant you want to cut (it will highlight in
blue) then press q. To add to your bouquet press 4 to display the vase and q
to add your flower. I really wanted to have multiple flowers and a point system
for flowers based on rarity but this took all of the time I had. The biggest
challenges were the water bar on the side (although it isnt too bad in hindsight)
and highlighting the plant when in its range. Also my scale was very off with my
first version so I had to resize everything, which wasnt a huge deal but it took
some time. Hope you enjoy the game! :)
